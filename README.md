# CU Lounge - A Food Ordering Website 

## About Project

The online food ordering system sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place the order as per they like.
Also, the online customers can easily track their orders. The management maintains customer’s database and improve food delivery service.
This system also provides a feedback system in which user can rate the food items.  Also, the proposed system can recommend hotels,
food, based on the ratings given by the user, the hotel staff will be informed for the improvements along with the quality. 
The payment can be made online or cash or pay-on-delivery system. For more secured ordering separate accounts are maintained for 
each user by providing them an ID and a password.

This system is a bunch of benefits from various point of views. As this online application enables the end users to register to the system 
online, select the food items of their choice from the menu list, and order food online.

Also the payment can be made through online mode or at the time of home delivery depending upon the customer’s choice and convenience. 
The selection made by the customers will be available to the hotel reception or to the person handling work assignment.

Now this same person will assign the orders to the specialist chef to be completed within a fixed duration of time.

As soon as the chef prepares the food, the later person forwards the parcels to the delivery persons assigned with the location
and customer identity of the customer along with the bill status.

With this application the work load of the waiter in the hotels are reduced or in some situations the work is abolished.

One of the various benefits of this is system is that if there is rush or a huge crowd present in the restaurant then in that
case sometimes unavailability of tables cut downs the restaurants customer.

Also there will be chances that the waiters are unavailable as they are busy in handling others, so the customer can directly
order the food to the chef online by using this application, by checking the seat availability in the restaurant.

This system allow the staff to serve customer within less time as compared to the manual system.
